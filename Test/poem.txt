“Twinkle, twinkle, little star, how I wonder what you are”
“Up above the world so high, like a diamond in the sky”
“When the blazing sun is gone, when he nothing shines upon”
“Then you show your little light, twinkle, twinkle all the night”
“Then the traveler in the dark thanks you for your tiny spark”
